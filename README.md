<h1>🚀 Building My Foundation in Robotics, Design, and Engineering — One Project at a Time</h1>

Every engineering journey begins with curiosity. Mine started with a simple question: How do machines sense, think, and move like living systems?

That curiosity led me into Automation & Robotics, and even as a second-year student, I’ve had opportunities to design mechanisms, collaborate with robotics teams, and work on projects that continuously expand my understanding.

My journey isn’t about being perfect — it’s about consistent progress and learning through real engineering challenges.

<h2>🛠️ Designing for Real-World Robotics</h2>

My strongest foundation right now is CAD design, which has taught me how to:
<ul>
<li>Transform ideas into functional 3D models</li>
<li>Build assemblies with constraints and motion</li>
<li>Apply GD&T for manufacturability</li>
<li>Run basic FEA to evaluate structural behavior</li>
<li>Design has become more than a tool — it’s the way I understand engineering problems.</li>
</ul>

<h2>🤝 Mechanical Design Experience — Team CiPHER</h2>

I’m currently a Mechanical Team Member (Design & Analysis) at Team CiPHER, where I contribute to real robotic systems.

Key responsibilities:
<ul>
<li>Designing parts, mechanisms, and sub-systems</li>

<li>Performing basic mechanical analysis & FEA</li>

<li>Making decisions on geometry, structure, and fitment</li>

<li>Collaborating across mechanical, electronics, and controls teams</li>

<li>Iterating designs based on testing and feedback</li>

<li>Working in a robotics team has accelerated my learning far beyond classroom theory.</li>
</ul>

<h2>📦 Projects That Built My Foundation</h2>
<ol>
<li><h3>🌊 VARUNA — Vision-Guided Autonomous Underwater Vehicle</h3>

A robotics project focused on underwater autonomy and perception.

My contributions include:
<ul>
<li>Designing pressure hull components</li>

<li>Thruster mounting geometry</li>

<li>Structural connectors and brackets</li>

<li>GD&T-based detailing</li>

<li>Assisting with buoyancy and balance calculations</li>

This project taught me how different underwater engineering is.
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<h3>🤖 Bot Wrestling Car</h3>

A high-torque combat-style bot designed for pushing and mechanical dominance.

Learnings from this project:
<ul>
<li>Chassis reinforcement and stiffness</li>

<li>Center-of-gravity optimization</li>

<li>High-torque motor placement and wheel geometry</li>

<li>Mechanical robustness under impact</li>

<li>Rapid prototyping for fast iteration</li>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>💻 Building Software Foundations</h2>

To complement mechanical design, I’m developing programming skills in:
<ul>
<li>Python — scripting, problem-solving, automation</li>

<li>C++ — essential for robotics, embedded logic, and ROS</li>
</ul>
These are still early-stage skills, but they’re critical for my long-term robotics goals.

<h2>🎯 Long-Term Goal: Humanoid Robotics</h2>

My vision is to contribute meaningfully to advanced humanoid systems — robots that move and interact with the world intelligently.

To get there, I’m focusing on:
<ul>
<li>Mechanical design</li>

<li>Simulation & analysis</li>

<li>Robotics fundamentals</li>

<li>ROS and control logic</li>

<li>Real engineering projects</li>
</ul>
Every project moves me one step closer.

<h2>✨ Closing Thoughts</h2>

Engineering isn’t about knowing everything at once.
It’s about asking questions, trying things, and learning with intention.

Each model I create, each mechanism I design, and each problem I solve strengthens my path toward the world of humanoid robotics.

If you're working on something similar, feel free to connect or collaborate.
